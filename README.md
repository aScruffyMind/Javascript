# Dynamic Dinogrid!
## Project #1: Object Oriented Javascript

### Big Picture

This app builds an infographic an infographic that is derived from data that is provided, as well as user input data. A 3x3 grid is generated with a human tile in the center. Each title contains the species, image and a random fact.  The human tile will display only the name of the user generating the grid and no facts.  The facts displayed are random per dinosaur, and 1 tile will be a pigeon that always displays the fact "All birds are living dinosaurs".
